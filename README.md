# How-i-took-my-self-10-years-back-in-aging-
Am getting younger everyday, am not different from where I was 10 years  ago.am physically and mentally fit. I go out and run 40km at similar pace that I can 10 years ago . I haven't developed any chronic conditions, and I haven't lost any kind of the physical function or vitality that I had 10 years ago. 

      daily routine   

I will be at the track, on the grass or in the gym 6 days a week. 

I usually aim to get 8 hours sleep. Sleeping is so important for us to recover and be able to train at peak level. Sometimes I can struggle with sleep so I have my own sleep routine. I always listen to music, usually pretty chilled-out music to relax my mind and allow me to easily switch off. It sounds silly but I also sleep and travel with a small pillow, which has been all over the world with me. It allows me to have a little home comfort and familiar smell. Sleeping in different beds and hotels can really effect sleep patterns. I have some friends who are elite athletes who have prescribed sleeping tablets. On the rare occasion I’ve slept with the help of Melatonin, usually only when we have flown a long way and struggling with jet lag. This really is a last resort for me. 


            Typical breakfast 


I begin the day with 2 boiled eggs, a banana, green tea and a Vitamin C and Zinc drink. I don’t take many dietary supplements but I like the idea that a little bit more Vitamin C can only help. Especially in the winter while we are exercising in cold, windy, moist conditions. 

Most days I exercise at 8:30 in the morning, I make sure I finish breakfast a good hour before I get to exercise, it is essential for me to be hydrated and fuelled for my exercises. Again I know this can very much vary between people, some of my workout buddy can’t stomach anything before training. Although I personally don’t agree with this. I can’t see how you’re meant to perform at your maximum ability on an empty stomach.


      typical lunch 

I tend to eat a lot of pasta, salad, and vegetables. 

A few dishes could be the following: 

- Two salmon fillets, couscous, broccoli
- Bruschetta, brown bread, avocado, onion, tomato, bacon and a light bit of olive oil
- Steak, boiled potatoes, green salad
- Two large jacket potatoes with Tuna mayo and salad
- Scrambled egg on sour dough bread, avocado with cherry tomatoes.


            Typical dinner


I love to go without meat , Typical dishes include: 

- Spaghetti bolognese, sometimes I replace the mince with Quorn. Even though I do love meat I think sometimes it’s good to go the occasional day without meat.
- Vegetable and prawn stir fry
- Chickpea and spinach curry
- Prawn and asparagus pasta
-  sautéed potatoes and green salad





Ultimately, I am enjoying myself with a lot of energy and vitality. I don't have any negative connotation about my aging  because I have no pathologies or functioning.
